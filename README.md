# `git-branch-delete`

`git-branch-delete` deletes branches with no diff between them and a reference
branch. For example, if you are on your `main` branch, and you have local feature
branches that were merged remotely (eg. via GitHub), you can fast-forward your
local `main` branch and then run `git-branch-delete` to prune the merged
branches. Branches with diffs will not be pruned. Branches that can not be
rebased on the updated `main` branch will not be pruned.
